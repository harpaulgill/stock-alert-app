# stock-alert-app
This app sends me an email alert anytime one of the stocks I follow falls below it 200 day moving average.  The code that is uploaded here has my email replaced with default text and the stocks it will give alerts for are the SP 500 and the Dow Jones Industrial Average.  Both these can be easily changed so that this can work for another individual and their portfolio.
